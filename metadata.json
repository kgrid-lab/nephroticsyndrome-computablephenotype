    ID and add terms for tests, examples, etc and think of how this would show up in metadata for a KO

    also  "purpose",
    "funder",
    "network",

    References is something referenced by the resource - in this case the paper references the GH repo but not the other way around 
    Lastname, Firstname is the appropriate syntax 
    What do we mean by @id and implemented by wrt cp?
